# To-Do App with OAuth and backend integration.  
Basic features include your normal to-do lists you'd want completed, with an added timer showing how much time you took to complete the said task. You can delete a task you haven't attempted, but you cannot delete one you've already started doing / decided to scrap it off later. Incomplete/Completed tasks would be archived with the timer so you can view them at a later point. With backend integration so your progress isn't lost - along with OAuth integration.  
  
This app was bootstrapped with create-react-app.
